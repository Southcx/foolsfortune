# The casebook: every bug fixed, its cause, and the rule it left

The owner, 2026-10-06: "whenever you fix a bug, annotate it somewhere for yourself in a log to reference so that we repeat fewer
implementation mistakes." One case per fix, newest first: what was seen, the cause (measured, not guessed), the fix, and **the rule**
(what to do or check next time so the same mistake is not made twice). Read the rules before building in the same area.
Every division writes here when it fixes something; a rule that a machine can check goes to `npm run check` or a test too.

Prior art: the aviation incident report and the medical case series (what happened, why, what changes), and a team's postmortem
log kept blameless and searchable.

## The rules, short (from the cases below)

1. **No two faces in one plane.** Before adding a floor, a slab or a decal, find what else lies in that plane (a ray down through the
   spot, or the zone's bounds): ceilings of rooms below have their tops at ground level. Cut the other one, or stand off by at least
   1.5 cm (1 mm is not enough at 20 m in a 24-bit depth buffer). Floors and slabs get `{ outline: false }`.
2. **A new zone moves things.** A zone test claims every mesh whose centre falls in it, and everything that asks `zoneOf` changes its
   answer there. Grep `zoneOf` and `zones.current` before adding one; ask `wholeOf` / `zones.whole` for "what ground is this".
3. **Pin the clock in every headless test.** Anything seeded by the game day (the Dunemaw's floors, the weather) changes daily.
4. **Times are the machine's; counts are the change's.** Before believing a perf time, measure the last published build on the same
   machine, back to back.
5. **A shader program is a cost.** A material variant no other mesh uses (instancing on a basic material, flat shading) compiles its
   own program; share an existing one.
6. **Clone skinned models with `SkeletonUtils.clone`**, never `.clone()` (the copy stays bound to the original's bones).
7. **Save records are copies, never live references** (JSON round trip at the write).
8. **Small bumps on a ramp add to the ramp.** Anything walkable stays under the controller's climb limit with its detail included.
9. **A route through doorways approaches each doorway square** (a point in front of it on each side): straight lines along a wall
   catch on anything standing proud of it.
10. **A rename is all the places, or none**: grep the old word across the repo, and read the stress test's page errors, not only its
    violation count.
11. **A character controller is handed a move along the ground, not into it.** On a slope, tip the level move onto the ground's plane;
    left to resolve a level move against a ramp, the controller climbs in uneven jumps.
12. **A correction layer is sprung, never snapped, and never fed by a foot in the air.** IK offsets and hip drops follow their targets
    with a damped spring at one rate both ways; the hips drop for the foot that stands, weighted by the clip's contact.
13. **Measure the parts, not the sum**: when something shakes, log each contributor per frame (the controller's height, each
    correction) before changing any of them; the first suspect was not the cause here.
14. **A surface tessellated by area costs by area.** Before growing anything built at so many vertices a metre (water, sand, a
    heightfield), multiply out its triangles; trim what is hidden (a box's dry corners) and say the rest in the perf baseline's reason.
15. **A module-wide uniform is everyone's.** Anything set every frame by one loop (the fade, the dissolve, the mind's time) is stale
    in a scene that loop does not run (the title, a workbench); reset it on the way out, and grep who else reads it. When a report
    will not reproduce, try the other end of the timeline first.
16. **Judge a face at play distance, not in its close-up**, and take away any line that only made sense on the shape it replaced.
17. **A warmed thing stays referenced.** A material disposed after the warm-up takes its program with it, and the first real one
    compiles again in play. Park warmed things hidden; never dispose them.
18. **The warm-up covers what is made on first need**, not only what stands in the scene at boot: a dressing laid on when a place is
    entered (a sandfall's curtain) is shown once in the warm-up, or it compiles in play.
19. **A tech's pose is drawn while its weight is above zero, not while its state is on.** The weight eases out after the state ends;
    a pose that stops at the state's end snaps. And measure a mocap clip before playing it: its pelvis against the base pose's (re-root
    it), and its per-frame jumps (mask a bone the capture got wrong).

20. **A tech reads its own key edge.** The core movement consumes its latches before or after a tech looks; a tech that starts on a
    press keeps the key's last state and detects the press itself, and a tech that spends a press marks it spent for the core
    (`jumpHeldLast`, `jumpBuf`). Test a tech by the chat line's `/art`, never by importing config into the page (another module copy).
21. **An event that sums an act fires after its last effect lands**, not when the input stops: what is still in flight (drops, a
    projectile) is part of the act.
22. **A coverage map is one channel, premultiplied, finer than its edges.** Split alphas and cells as coarse as the feature show
    the grid; filter premultiplied colour so an edge fades toward the colour, never toward black.

23. **A move to a place sets that place's floor in the same step.** The fall height is read by the next fixed step, before the frame
    that would have updated it: whatever sets the Courier down far below (a far dock, a Well) lowers `player.killY` under them first
    (`places.stand`, `course.toDunes`).

24. **A material made once for the whole game is marked `userData.shared`.** Whatever is taken down (a Well floor, the bowl) disposes
    every material it holds that is not marked; a global one disposed loses its program and recompiles at its next draw, a hitch.

25. **Nothing is taken out of a list from inside that list's own update.** A callback a module calls per member (a jelly's `driven`)
    marks the member (`c.reached`); the owner removes it after the loop. A Rapier body removed mid-loop panics the whole world.

## Cases

### 2026-10-07 · The raid's brood, fed to the FOE, panicked the physics ("unreachable")
- **Seen:** headless drive of the raid, the transition: a Rapier `unreachable` in `setNextKinematicTranslation`, then every call into the
  world "recursive use of an object".
- **Cause, measured:** a brood reaching the FOE was fed and disposed inside its own `driven` callback, which `SlipJellies.update` calls
  per jelly; the loop went on to move the disposed jelly's removed body.
- **Fix:** `driven` only marks it (`c.reached`); `raid.update` feeds and disposes after the jellies' loop (`world/well/raid.js`).
- **Rule:** 25.

### 2026-10-07 · Every Well floor taken down recompiled the outlines
- **Seen:** perf after Round 1: two shader programs compiled after the warm-up (was none), both the outline's back-face basic, with keys
  identical to programs compiled at boot; they appeared on the third floor, the first to stand pots (outlined) once the second was gone.
- **Cause, measured:** taking a floor down (`wellkit.js` dispose) released three basic programs to zero users. The floor disposes every
  material in its group not marked `userData.shared`, and the outlines it carries are `OUTLINE_MAT`, one material for the whole game
  (`render/outline.js`): disposed, every outline in the game lost its program and the next outlined thing drawn compiled it again. It
  has done so at every floor change since the floors were outlined; the pots made the perf gate see it.
- **Fix:** the outline materials are marked shared where they are made (`makeOutlineMaterial`).
- **Rule:** 24.

### 2026-10-07 · Set down at Margarite's dock, the Courier was "fallen" and woke at the workshop
- **Seen:** `places.stand` to the dock (418 m down, outside the dunes) left them at the workshop, headless.
- **Cause:** the fall height was last frame's (the workshop's, -100 m); the next fixed step saw them below it and respawned them before
  main.js recomputed it for the dock.
- **Fix:** `places.stand` lowers `killY` under the point it sets them down (as `toDunes` does); main.js's own rule counts the dock and the crossing.
- **Rule:** 23.

### 2026-10-06 · Stains and paint drawn as squares (the brush load, headless shots)
- **Seen:** spilled crude and fresh paint showed half-metre squares with dark rims.
- **Cause:** the paint map kept two alphas (paint, stain) in one texel and cells of 0.5 m, as coarse as a drop; filtered unpremultiplied,
  every edge blended toward black.
- **Fix:** one coverage channel, premultiplied RGBA8, 0.25 m cells (`world/ground/paintmap.js`); stains then moved to Calissa's own
  meshes (`vfx/stains.js`, `world/ground/stains.js`), out of the map.
- **Rule:** 22.

### 2026-10-06 · The paint event fired twice for one spray
- **Cause:** `brush.paint` was flushed on the release, and the drops still in the air landed after it and flushed a second.
- **Fix:** the flush waits for the last drop (`paintDue`, `tools/soulbrush/load.js`).
- **Rule:** 21.

### 2026-10-06 · The Rocket never launched, and the Hover started again in the same airtime
- **Cause:** the Rocket read the jump latch before the core filled it (and the test toggled the art through an imported config, a
  different module instance); once started, the core's own jump overwrote the launch. The Hover had no memory of having been spent.
- **Fix:** the Rocket detects the Space press itself and marks it spent for the core (`jumpHeldLast`, `jumpBuf`), and launches by
  `P.impulse`; the Hover is spent until grounded (`courier/moves/jets.js`); tests toggle by `/art`.
- **Rule:** 20.

### 2026-10-06 · The kick's bad loop and no blending (the owner's report, through Dovina; Calissa)
- **Seen:** the kick (V) snapped back at its end and jerked when kicked again.
- **Cause (measured):** three things.
  - `Kick.animate` returned as soon as the state left `'kick'` (at 0.5 s), while the techs' weight was still easing out (`techs.js`, at 12 a second), so the body snapped back. The largest bone rotation in one frame was 159° (forearmL, at frame 31).
  - The CMU clips' pelvis stands 0.39 m (kick_a) and 0.97 m (kick_b) forward of the base pose's (0, 0.73, -0.04), so blending in threw the body forward. The pelvis's largest offset from the Courier was 1.21 m.
  - The capture's toes jump up to 50° in one frame.
- **Fix** (`courier/moves/kick.js`):
  - the last frame is held while the weight eases out;
  - a kick begun over the last crossfades from where the body was (0.12 s);
  - the clip's pelvis is taken relative to its own first frame;
  - the toes keep the base pose.

  Measured after, on the same run of kicks: the pelvis's largest offset 0.22 m (the kick's own step), and the largest rotation in one frame 34° (the right foot, mid-swing).
- **Rule:** 19.

### 2026-10-06 · A sandfall's curtain compiled in play (the perf gate's late compile, R46)
- **Seen:** `dunemaw-sandfall-door` compiled after the warm-up once the prefab rooms changed which floor the gate measured.
- **Cause:** the curtain is dressed on only when a floor is entered (`vfx/welldress.js`); the warm-up's stand-in floor had none. A
  first fix showed one in the warm-up and then disposed it, which released its program, so it compiled again in play.
- **Fix:** the warm-up's stand-in floor holds one falling curtain, parked hidden with the floor (`world/well/dunemaw.js` prewarm). Late
  compiles 1 to 0.
- **Rules:** 17, 18.

### 2026-10-06 · The dunes shot gained 94,000 triangles when the Weir's pond was tripled (the perf gate)
- **Measured** (the dunes shot's meshes by triangles, the head against the commit before): only `liquid-water` changed, 56,000 to
  149,568. The water surface (`vfx/water.js` `waterGeometry`) is four vertices a metre over the volume's bounding box, and the box grew
  with the pond (82 by 57 m); a third of the box is sand.
- **Fix:** the water mesh drops the triangles whose three corners are dry (`depthAt` <= 0; `courier/moves/env.js` `dryTrimmed`):
  291,398 in the shot (was 340,356; 253,616 before the pond grew). The rest is the owner's larger pond, recorded in the baseline.
- **Rule:** 14.

### 2026-10-06 · The Courier shook on slopes, worst running up a Dunemaw ramp (the owner, R46: "animations all fighting for dominance")
- **Measured** (`scratchpad`-style probe, 60 Hz, a 6 m over 18 m ramp): the hips' frame-to-frame unevenness was 20 mm running uphill,
  17 down, against 5.7 on flat ground. Split by part: the controller's own height stepped 6 to 59 mm a frame where 38 was due
  (its climb and autostep taking turns); the foot IK pulled the swinging foot to the ground and dropped the hips for it, the drop
  jumping from foot to foot each step; the reach correction pumped (40/s down, 10/s up).
- **Fix:** the grounded move is tipped onto the ground's plane (`courier/player.js` move); each foot's ground offset is sprung
  (FOOT_FOLLOW), the hips drop for the standing foot by the clip's contact and are sprung (PELVIS_FOLLOW), the reach correction has one
  rate (REACH_FOLLOW) (`courier/character.js` footIK). After: the controller climbs 41 to 43 mm every frame; the hips 4.75 mm uphill
  (was 20), 4.8 down (was 17), 3.5 on flat (was 5.7).
- **Rules:** 11, 12, 13.
### 2026-10-06 · The Courier semi-transparent after the trailer was skipped (the owner's report, R45; Calissa)
- **Seen:** on the title, after skipping the opening trailer, the Courier was drawn see-through.
- **Cause:** the camera-near fade (`main.js`, `character.setFade`) writes one module-wide uniform (`fadeUniform`, `render/outline.js`),
  and the title's own Courier shares it. The trailer's opening close-ups (0 to 3.2 s) faded it to 0.2..0.6 (measured), and the title
  runs no world tick to set it again. A skip at 9.6 s or later never showed it, which is why the first tries could not reproduce it.
- **Fix:** no cinema shot fades the Courier (`|| game.cinema?.shots?.size`); leaving the trailer's world sets the fade to 1
  (`cine/overture.js` `leaveWorld`). Measured after: the fade never below 1 through the trailer, and 1 after a skip at 1.5 s.
- **Rule:** 15.

### 2026-10-06 · The mask's E-ink face rolled back (the owner, R45; Calissa)
- **Seen:** the owner: the pupils too small; the rim round the eyes did not read.
- **Cause:** the bake kept the maker's shadow rim round every reshaped eye, so a lidded or cut eye showed the ghost of the whole one;
  the pupils were 15 px in a 116 px eye on the 512 px mask, judged in a close-up and never at play distance.
- **Fix:** reverted (`d4872d0`); the owner is making the atlas to puppeteer (ART.md, "The Courier's face").
- **Rule:** 16.

### 2026-10-06 · The Throwing Room's floor flickered (the owner's report, v86)
- **Seen:** a dark patch with a stair-stepped edge crawling across the room's floor as the camera moved.
- **Cause:** the basement's east ceiling slab (`world/basement/basement.js`, top at y 0) ran under the whole room; the room's floor top
  was also at y 0. Two faces in one plane. A ray from the camera met both at the same distance. Also, the floor box had an outline
  hull, and the lane stood only 1 mm over a plank.
- **Fix:** the ceiling slab goes round the room's footprint; the floor has no outline; the lane 1.5 cm over the planks, the ring 1 cm
  over the lane.
- **Rule:** 1.

### 2026-10-06 · The Throwing Room's zone would have rained indoors and silenced the music
- **Seen (before shipping):** with a `testroom` zone, `weather.placeOf` and the music chooser asked `zoneOf`, got 'testroom', found
  no place and no cue.
- **Fix:** `zones.whole`; the weather and the music ask the whole (Dovina's and Wanda's one-word fixes).
- **Rule:** 2.

### 2026-10-06 · The Dunemaw playtest failed on some days only
- **Cause:** the Dunemaw's floors are the game day's (`wellSeed`); the playtest did not pin the calendar, and on four days of six the
  way up was farther than the agent's 30 sim seconds.
- **Fix:** the playtest pins the calendar (`--clock`); a walk across a floor gets 90 sim seconds.
- **Rule:** 3.

### 2026-10-06 · Slopes in the Dunemaw stalled the Courier to 0 m/s
- **Cause:** sand ripples (0.2 m, 3.2 m crest to crest) laid on a 23 degree ramp made 44 degree crests, at the controller's 46 degree
  climb limit. Measured with the controller's contact normals.
- **Fix:** ramps carry no ripple; their ends are rounded; flat lanes from doorway to doorway.
- **Rule:** 8.

### 2026-10-06 · The agent wedged against an arch's pilaster
- **Cause:** a route to a doorway's middle ran along the wall from the side; the new pilaster stood 0.45 m proud of it.
- **Fix:** the route passes a point 1.8 m in front of each doorway on each side.
- **Rule:** 9.

### 2026-10-06 · The testing room cost a shader program of its own
- **Cause:** the spray wall's dents were an InstancedMesh with a MeshBasicMaterial (the only instanced basic material in the game),
  and the console's wood was flat-shaded.
- **Fix:** the dents are one plain mesh written in place; the wood smooth-shaded.
- **Rule:** 5.

### 2026-10-06 · Perf "regressed" by 25 to 45 % in every zone at once
- **Cause:** a new container: the published build measured on it ran as slow as the head.
- **Fix:** none needed; the baseline re-recorded with the reason.
- **Rule:** 4.

### 2026-10-06 · An achievement's sub-category not in CATS (boot page error)
- **Cause:** a rename done in one of five places; the stress test's page errors were not read.
- **Fix:** all five renamed (Espada).
- **Rule:** 10.

### 2026-10-06 · Doubled Lachryma tools in the Pneuka Box
- **Cause:** the save kept section records as live references to the box's arrays, so restoring after a hold re-added tools.
- **Fix:** records are JSON copies at the write; `box.reconcile()` removes extra copies.
- **Rule:** 7.

### 2026-10-06 · The title's Clapperjar stood behind the Courier whatever its position said
- **Cause:** a skinned model copied with `.clone()` stays bound to the original's skeleton.
- **Fix:** `SkeletonUtils.clone`.
- **Rule:** 6.

### 2026-10-06 · Mirroring the Crucibelle to the other hip flipped its bell
- **Cause:** mirroring as M·G·M also mirrored the tool's own axis.
- **Fix:** mirror the socket, then flip the local Y (`mirrorSide`).
- **Rule:** when mirroring a held thing, mirror where it is, not what it is.
