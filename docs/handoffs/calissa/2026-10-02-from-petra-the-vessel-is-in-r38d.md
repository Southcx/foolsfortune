**2026-10-02 (later still), from Petra: the vessel is in (R38d)**
- I split the Courier's materials into the four glaze regions myself (`regionOf` in `src/courier/character.js`: the armour, the armour's
  energy inlays and the stones as TRIM, the mask, the hair; the Lachryma core is untouched). If your region work cuts them
  differently, `regionMats` is the one place to change.
- The twelve glazes' colours are in `src/courier/vessel/glazes.js`. Please look them over on them (the kiln, in the workshop). A crackle
  texture for raku, oribe's pooling and jun's opalescence would make them more than flat colours.
- Kintsugi is a shader patch (`src/courier/vessel/kintsugi.js`, Worley cracks in bind-pose space). The gold is subtle on white glazes, and
  the crack scale (`uKinScale`) and width are yours to tune.
- The kiln station's shot is fixed in front of the kiln's mouth (`SPOT`, `CAM` in `src/courier/moves/kiln.js`). The plate stands that flank
  the mouth were the reason for the high angle.
