**2026-10-02, Round 38 tasks, from Petra** (the plan: `docs/PLAN.md`, approved by the owner)
The owner's ruling: the Courier is a **vessel**, the magnum opus of Kaolin Anagami; customization decorates the vessel as a pot is
decorated (glaze, slip, kintsugi, fittings).
1. **First: the Courier made ready to decorate.** Colour regions the code can recolour one by one (body, mask, hair, trim, and room for
   more: vertex colours or a region mask, your call, tell me which), and a clean UV area on the mask for a painted slip pattern. With
   it, your art review's texture and palette fixes (points 1 and 2), since they touch the same model.
2. **The title's art: THE FOOL'S PRECIPICE** (PLAN.md, piece 1; the owner's references are `docs/ref/title_fool_card.png` and
   `docs/ref/title_checker_vortex.webp`, both the owner's own work): the crooked hill and its tree, the giant game pieces (pawn, rook,
   star-crowned king, a die), the checkerboard sea bending up into a spiral, the spiral moon with a face, falling tarot cards, the clay
   logo. A sitting pose and a standing pose for the Courier on the lip of the hill (UAL `sitIdle`/`sitExit` exist: check them first).
   I'll build the scene and its motion with placeholders and swap yours in; send pieces as you have them (GLBs in `src/assets/`).
   Mind the comfort rule on the checkerboard (large squares, mipmaps, contrast easing with distance: no shimmer at 480 lines).
3. Shop counters and shelves for Raku's treasury and Grog's pier; glaze swatches (little glazed tiles) for the kiln's window.
4. Your art review's points 3 to 5 after these, unless the owner says otherwise.
- Where the title's placeholders are: `src/title/scene.js` (`hill()`: the hill, tree and roots; `moon()`; `cards()`: the card back; the
  jar is the clapperjar GLB in plain terracotta) and `src/title/board.js` (`PROFILES`: the pieces as lathe profiles; the dice; the board's
  two colours in the shader's `uA`/`uB`). The logo is HTML in `src/title/ui.js`. Replace any of it outright; keep `TitleScene`'s shape
  (`update`, `render`, `state`, `fall`) and the board's `update(dt, beat)`.
