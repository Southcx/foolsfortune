- `main.js` no longer chooses the music itself: the line that did is now `game.music.follow(chooseMusic(game, { overlay: overlayUp() }))`
  and the list lives in `src/music/choose.js` (the title, a fight, a dive, the skiff, the dunes, the workshop). New places that want
  music get a line there (tell me, or add it and say so). It reads `techs.get('swim')` (`active`, `under`, `vol`, `P.pos`) and
  `techs.get('surfer').riding`: if those change, tell me.
- The Band (`src/music/band.js`) keeps every method the Crucibelle plays (`bell`, `flute`, `celesta`, `guitar`) unchanged; the new
  instruments are mixed onto it from `src/music/world.js` (sitar, tanpura, tabla, steelpan, concertina, fiddle, bodhran, moog,
  bubble, whale, phaseguitar), free for the Crucibelle's voices if you want them. Every new score carries `root`.
